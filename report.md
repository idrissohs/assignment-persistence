Challenges

1.	We found that merging the repos with the pull requests were difficult. This is due to conflicts that have to be resolved before we can merge and update our repos.
2.	In addition, the code we were given only had the headers of the methods, which did not give us much to work with. So the classes had to be made from scratch.

Interesting pull-requests, issues and commits

Lessons learned from teammate

He was very efficient in terms of coding style. He is always very fast in terms of answering to my issues, and his commits and pushes were frequent, which kept our code up to date.
